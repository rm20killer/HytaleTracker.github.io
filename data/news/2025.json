When asked about social systems, Simon affirms support for friends system (potentially on Day 1) and other social systems. When asked about the world, Simon says having a 'living world' is critical, with wind sounds/visuals and NPCs changing behavior (partially) based on time/weather. Wanting to avoid formal tutorials, Simon expresses love for charm/mechanics that create player stories, describing a scenario where taking care of a wounded animal could teach the basics of survival - likely post-launch.",

Java is used for the backend because it aids in speed of development, enables developers to be trained more easily, and already has a massive server/modding community. Additionally, Simon says he'd try to make parts of the game shared source or open source, with a bounty system for bugs/features. When asked about a launcher, Simon explains that the game would be updated very frequently, making an independent launcher ideal initially - though Simon believes a Steam release would be best down the line (following in Path of Exile's footsteps), with a goal being Hytale on the Steam Deck (with Windows/Mac support confirmed + Linux potentially being possible). Of course, Custom Input Support would also be ideal.",
