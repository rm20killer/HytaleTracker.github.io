When you get to the point of rewriting every system (and even things like music), Simon says, you've lost the plot. Simon believes the AI Combat system, which had previously been showcased, likely had to be rewritten for the new (Forge) engine.",

Simon says Riot was good to him when he left, and gave freedom to the team, and he even turned down 'way more' money from a different company at the last moment because he truly believed Riot Games gave the team/game the best chance of success.",
