        "mainText": "According to Simon, some features in the trailer were broken/in early development, but most of it was easily fixable. Everything was filmed using in-game cinematic tools, which allowed placement of cameras and usage of events (like the dragon shot at the end). Simon says cinematic tools were invested in because the team understands how important YouTube is to a game's success. Some shots in the trailer were scripted, due to lack of players, and NPCs were used to make it feel more alive - specifically the minigames and end shot in the trailer. Simon notes three specific features: #1 being the mounts & hot air balloon, which used a band-aid solution, but could be fixed in a couple of weeks and might have been done already, #2 being minecarts with jumping not being implemented, and #3 being the World Map which was using a better UI than what was in-game at the time. After the trailer's release, the features shown were top priority to be completed. Simon clarifies that the trailer was faithful to the game and vision in 2018, and explains that the cinema tools allowed users to record their actions and play it back.",

Continuing that sentiment, Simon states he doesn't care about how much polished content is already in the game, as the community would help polish it over the years. Turning to servers, Simon reveals that he believes most Hypixel classic minigames were cancelled in Hytale's new direction, but with Day 1 player-hosted servers and an eventual Servers Tab, minigames would be created by the community - potentially aided by official prototypes/maps. The average player could aid the game by reporting bugs, requesting features, creating content, and generally participating in the community.",

When asked about the world, Simon says having a 'living world' is critical, with wind sounds/visuals and NPCs changing behavior (partially) based on time/weather.

Java is used for the backend because it aids in speed of development, enables developers to be trained more easily, and already has a massive server/modding community. Additionally, Simon says he'd try to make parts of the game shared source or open source, with a bounty system for bugs/features. When asked about a launcher, Simon explains that the game would be updated very frequently, making an independent launcher ideal initially - though Simon believes a Steam release would be best down the line (following in Path of Exile's footsteps), with a goal being Hytale on the Steam Deck (with Windows/Mac support confirmed + Linux potentially being possible). Of course, Custom Input Support would also be ideal.",

Simon continues by saying that a large percentage of a company's worth is in the people - which Hytale no longer has - and that because the Legacy Engine is not cross-platform and because the New Engine is far from playable, Hytale isn't a great value to most medium/big studios. These details make his bid the only decent option for Hytale, in his eyes.",
