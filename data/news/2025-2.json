        "mainText": "On November 17th, 2025, AntVenom published an Exclusive Interview with Simon. In the interview, Simon stated he believes his decision to sell Hytale was still the right decision, as it secured funding for the team, and put him in position to be able to purchase Hytale and attempt to save it. While the goal is to reach the vision of Hytale presented in the trailer, things will change due to the changes in circumstances/genre over the years. Simon repeatedly states that the community should keep expectations low, realize the game will launch with many bugs and missing features, but maintain confidence that the game will eventually be great. The trailer was 'ambitious, but achievable.' Simon says he wants players to feel at home - safe, comfortable, and excited - when they play Hytale for the first time. When asked about a 'credits roll' moment, Simon says he envisions credits never rolling, with the story continuing to be updated for years - no defined end point in development. When asked about a roadmap, Simon says the first goal is launch - then create a decent gameplay loop. Success for Hytale means releasing as soon as possible, and updating one feature at a time for a long time. Simon finishes the interview by thanking the believers.",
