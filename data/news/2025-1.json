Further more, Simon says the new vision for Hytale under Riot was akin to Roblox 2.0, with Fortnite-style events - and all gameplay features were 'redone' for sake of perfection as promises were added. In the end, the new vision got zero players, and Simon now believes that an indie setup is the only path for Hytale to be saved while still being *Hytale* -- and the SaveHytale movement helped him feel comfortable pursuing it.",

While he thinks his offer might be a bit too much, he's offering more money to avoid a delay that permanently vaults the game - but he's optimistic and will be relieved/excited either way. Based off his last two negotiations with Riot ('18 and '19), he expects the negotiations to last at least a couple of months. Simon says it's likely a bad financial decision on his part, but he'll only do it if he gets 100% control.",
