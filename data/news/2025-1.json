        "mainText": "According to Simon, a Creator Code-like system is possible, with an option to receive revenue sharing from Hytale itself - meaning all mods could be free, but modders could still make money. A Creator Code-like system intended for mod devs would need to avoid adding complexity to accounting, and would need an automated application process. When asked about servers being Pay To Win, Simon says no official server or content would be P2W, and any P2W server wouldn't appear in the server browser. Looking to Microsoft and Roblox, Simon says Microsoft has fought to keep P2W out of Minecraft but it's a losing battle, and Roblox promotes P2W content to reap money - Hytale would only promote \"clean\" servers, potentially letting them access more things.",

Shifting gears, Simon says the rewritten PVP and Parkour systems would be kept, and while there was a prototyped automation system, he'd consider hiring a modder who developed a sufficient automation mod. Finally, Simon confirms that trees do fall.",

Mods/Private Servers would be able to add cosmetics, but wouldn't work globally. Keeping a large free catalog of cosmetics, with custom cosmetics being voted on to be added. Simon states that no player-made skins is the only compromise to have more freedom in the rest of the game, and to keep the art identity intact. User Generated Content could be handled similar to Valve's method, and the skin system would eventually have non-human features and animal hoods (instead of Furry cosmetics). When presented with Hawkon's Hytale Cosmetics video, Simon agrees with many points (given time to get there).",

        "mainText": "Simon states that some of Riot's decision makers aren't aware of the SaveHytale movement at all, and some people in the industry don't play games or look at their communities at all - forcing him to speak the universal language: money. Further more, Simon says the new vision for Hytale under Riot was akin to Roblox 2.0, with Fortnite-style events - and all gameplay features were 'redone' for sake of perfection as promises were added. In the end, the new vision got zero players, and Simon now believes that an indie setup is the only path for Hytale to be saved while still being *Hytale* -- and the SaveHytale movement helped him feel comfortable pursuing it.",

While he thinks his offer might be a bit too much, he's offering more money to avoid a delay that permanently vaults the game - but he's optimistic and will be relieved/excited either way. Based off his last two negotiations with Riot ('18 and '19), he expects the negotiations to last at least a couple of months. Simon says it's likely a bad financial decision on his part, but he'll only do it if he gets 100% control.",
