        <h3>"What is Exploration mode?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Exploration mode temporarily replaces adventure mode as our vision for adventure mode is far from what it can offer at the moment.
        We will use exploration as a solid foundation of the game, make a living world, and over time we will introduce features that will build
        and become Adventure mode. We want to add dungeons, epic boss fights, and much more in the future, but to get there we want to build a strong 
        core game that feels like home. In Exploration Mode, you can fight, loot, farm, explore, build, and play with friends - it's more of a prologue
        to what Hytale will be. It's using World Gen version 1 while we are finishing up Version 2 for Orbis, a blog post will eventually explain the two
        world gens in the coming days!</blockquote>

        <h3>"How does the road ahead look?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Short-medium term I want to focus on fast wins for the game, we don't want to work several months on a single update, we want to bombard the players
        with constant updates and when we feel we have caught up and the core game feels solid, then we will be embarking on bigger updates. We have
        several milestones we want to achieve, but what matters most is staying agile in your development to pivot at any time if needs be.</blockquote>

        <h3>"You say you're wanting to make the game you've always wanted to play as a kid and the one you were proud of for generations to come.
        Is there a specific system or feature that comes to mind reflecting this?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- I think when it comes to block games, there is strong opportunity to have a great fantasy aspect to the game genre, introduce interesting features 
        that are typing in RPGs or even ARPGs. The system with portals in the end game we are working on might be simple at launch, but in the long term vision 
        it will be one feature that truly allows us to expand our creativity.</blockquote>

        <h3>"What part of the game will people witness very early on and notice is immediately broken or lacking right now?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- It's missing minigames for early access, which is upsetting because we are Hypixel aftera ll, known for minigames since 2013. As for broken things, 
        I think the core gameloop is lacking behind, we had to start from scratch so we did the best we could in a few days given the issues we had to deal with 
        at the time. I'm confident we will have a great game in a few months, just need players to be patient!</blockquote>

        <h3>"What makes Hytale different right now? Why is a cool mod pack for Minecraft not on the same level as Hytale?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Movements, combat, vibe, controls. The world gen v2 and ability to mod the game is very exciting to me.</blockquote>

        <h3>"How do you see 3rd party multiplayer working at launch and thereafter?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Initially people will make their private servers, then slowly as the game matures we will see more and more public servers coming online, we will 
        support them the best we can. Eventually when we launch our own minigames, we will be giving out a lot of tech for the server owners.</blockquote>

        <h3>"The vision for Hytale has pivoted a lot over the years with the recodes and everything. What is Simon's specific take and vision for the game?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- It's a bit of RPG/Sandbox, but more fantasy based than other block games. I want the art to lift up the game, I want the living world to be worlds apart.
        If the game is successful, I will invest heavily towards NPCs living in the world, having their own lives. I also want to make sure modding is 
        prioritized while we do this, doing so will accelerate our own development.</blockquote>

        <h3>"For people curious about Adventure and Exploration mode, in simple terms, what does game progression look like at the moment? What do you imagine a player 
        doing in their first hour, 10 hours, and 50 hours of gameplay?"</h3>

        <blockquote>- Right now it's pretty simple, I don't want Hytale to be a survival game. I want Hytale to be an adventure. Easy to learn, hard to master. Horizontal 
        progression, give enough options to players to be creative in combat. Keep in mind, there was no game progression a few weeks ago, so it's barebone and not 
        great, I will fix it, it's my mission.</blockquote>
